# Expense Tracker

Powered by CRA, I created a React Expense Tracker where the user can log in their expenses, as well as filter by year and view their total expenses in a bar chart. You can view the demo here! -> [Expense Tracker](https://nm-expense-tracker.netlify.app/)

# Very cool! How do I get this up and running on my end?
